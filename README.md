# Ulviyya's Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio! üöÄ Here, you'll find a collection of projects and dashboards built using Python, Power BI and SQL, showcasing my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analysis

## Python Projects

### [Project 1: Advanced Statistical Analysis Using Python](https://github.com/eliyevaulviye/Advanced-Statistical-Analysis)
This project analyzes mental health factors affecting students, including academic pressure, depression, anxiety, isolation, and sports engagement. The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from a Mental Health Survey, and the study involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover patterns in student mental well-being.
Steps in Analysis
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values and filled missing numeric values with the mean.
Removed duplicate rows.
Identified and removed outliers using the Z-score method (threshold = 3).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several visualizations were created to analyze key factors:

Depression Levels by Gender ‚Äì A box plot visualizing depression differences across genders.
Distribution of Academic Pressure ‚Äì A histogram showing the frequency distribution of academic pressure.
Sports Engagement by Gender ‚Äì A count plot analyzing participation in sports by gender.
Correlation Matrix ‚Äì A heatmap illustrating relationships between academic pressure, depression, anxiety, and isolation.
üìà Key Findings
There may be a correlation between academic pressure and mental health factors such as anxiety and depression.
Sports engagement varies by gender, which might impact mental well-being.
The correlation matrix provides insights into how mental health factors relate to each other.
üìÇ Technologies Used
Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn)
Google Colab 

## SQL Projects

### [Project 1: Nashville Housing data cleaning using SQL](https://github.com/eliyevaulviye/Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning-)
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Nashville Housing Dataset using SQL. The dataset contains property records, including addresses, ownership details, and sale information.

üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Steps:
Filled missing property addresses using available parcelIDs.
Split property and owner addresses into separate columns for street, city, and state.
Standardized categorical values (e.g., changed 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in the SoldAsVacant column).
Removed unnecessary columns to enhance the dataset efficiency.
